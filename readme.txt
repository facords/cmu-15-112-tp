Project Name: chess [ai]

Project Description:
Chess [ai] is a classic chess game that can be played in either one player or two player mode. The game enforces all chess rules and keeps track of turns and all check, checkmate, and draw conditions. The game also allows all special moves, including king-side and queen-side castling, en passant capturing, and pawn promotion to the queen piece. In one player mode, the game can be played at three levels of difficult against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The difficulty level is determined by how deep the minimax algorithm recursively searches the game tree.
